# WirelessSoundControl
# Volume Control with Hand Gestures
## 🎮 Introduction

This project enables wireless control of system volume using hand gestures. The implementation utilizes the MediaPipe package, which aids in detecting the distance between fingers. The volume is adjusted based on the detected finger distance: shorter distances result in lower volume, and vice versa. The input for this project is video captured through a webcam, and our model predicts the system's volume at each instance in the video.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

This project heavily relies on [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/), a cross-platform library developed by Google. MediaPipe provides powerful and ready-to-use machine learning solutions for various computer vision tasks.

## 📹 Input and Prediction

- **Input:** Video from a webcam
- **Prediction:** The system's volume at each instance in the video

## 🛠️ Dependencies
